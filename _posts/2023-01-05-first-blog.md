This is my first blog, and I am ready to keep going post something here. It could be something I learned, it could be something I wanted, or something that I had experienced.

So, in recent, I have got some learning target already.

The first thing should be the programming language, probably is reactJS
The second one is the English, I will read some books, check the unknown vocabular and write them down here.
Next...
No any other idea yet.

Hope that I can keep it on.
